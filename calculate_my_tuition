Full-time student if taking 12 or more credits.
Maryland residents pay a lower tuition.
Differential tuition applies to juniors and seniors in business, engineering, and computer science majors.
Examples of using the program:
python3 calculate_my_tuition.py -c 12 -nr -dt
python3 calculate_my_tuition.py --credits 15 --dt
python3 calculate_my_tuition.py --nonresident
